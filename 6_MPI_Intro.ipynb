    "The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a set of library functions, methods, and specifications that can be called to distribute a code's processing work between nodes or processors on the same node. It does this by passing messages between the processors. It is governed by a set of community driven standards. MPI is designed to allows users to easily perform distributed parallel processing. \n",
