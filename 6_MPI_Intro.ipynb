    "## Message Passing Interface (MPI) Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Performance Computing is a field that leverages parallel processing to solve complex problems efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to parallel programming is the `Message Passing Interface (MPI)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use Python and MPI to analyze power outage data from EAGLE-i, which contains information about the number of power outages, aggregated by county, in 15-minute time intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how using multiple processors to our advantage can save time when working with large datasets, and use the MPI for Python (`mpi4py`) package, which provides a simple Python interface to the MPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI is designed to allows users to easily perform distributed parallel processing across multiple processors on a single computer or even multiple nodes on an HPC system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eagle-i data (2014-2022 dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15skV7CWnMBLkrGIPmLrh1GgNPA00iUuB)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "1. Load and pre-process the power outage data\n",
    "2. Divide the data into chunks to distribute among MPI processes\n",
    "3. Implement parallel processing using MPI\n",
    "4. Analyze and interpret the results\n",
